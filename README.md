# Weather Overview - Complete

After developing a simple [weather overview](https://github.com/comarialuiza/weather-overview) application, I wanted to develop a more complex one, inspired by [this](https://dribbble.com/shots/10460680-Weather-App) design I found on dribble. It was a great opportunity for me to study more React concepts, specially the Context API. The website was deployed on Netlyfy and you can see it [here](https://weather-overview.netlify.app/).
